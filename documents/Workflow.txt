Slackbot - idea: appdemo current usage/ shared resources

list = List all resources
list|available =  List all resources which are currently available

add|<name>  				Add a resource with name <name>
add|<name>,<name>,<name>,... add multiple resources

remove|<name>             Remove the resource with name <name>

claim|<name>|[duration] ""   Claim resource with name <name>
                          If [duration] is not applied, defaults to 1 hour.
                          Example durations are: "for 1 day", "until tonight"
						  
release|<name>            Release your claim on resource with name <name>



----------------------------------------
it will maintain a list of all demos, list of available, anyone can claim, release(if claimed) a demo bucket

claim karega toh duration puchega, if the duration is not set then default duration(2 weeks - 1 sprint) 
when duration is about to end, confirm karega with the person who claimed, if he wants to extend, unless he/she has released the resource

Sabkuch mongo me store karege
----------------------------------------
Whenever we add the Bot in a group, it will create a collection for that group - DB - USED CHANNEL ID in existing resource schema as too complicated which is not necessary given the scope of the solution

Channel name and post the message in the same channel - DONE

multi add - DONE

Cron Job - DONE

Deploy - DONE

About to Expire - Ask the owner to extend if required - DONE

Error text when you add the bot in the channel - DONE

remove should be password protected? - DONE (added check if already claimed, also added --force flag)

Issue: Multiple add - unique name in list - DONE

---------------
Refactor  
	- Avoid passing channelId to each function - DONE, using currentChannelId as var
	- Move switch case from sb-connection to db-connection inside a method and just call that method from sb-connection. This will ease checkResourceExists
	- DB CONNECTION - SINGLE LINE PROMISE - DONE
	- SLACK MODAL - different for modal and for message - DONE
	
Test cases - DONE
Automation testing - List of commands to run and expected result.
